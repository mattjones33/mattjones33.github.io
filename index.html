                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <p>The 5 KEY points for a successful escape room</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Has this been done before? Did the room make me think creatively to solve a problem? Was one type of puzzle overrepresented?</li>
                    <li><strong>Production Value</strong>: Does it look nice? Was I immersed in the room? Did everything work like it was supposed to?</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Were the puzzles too simple? Were the puzzles too hard/tedious? Were the directions clear, or did I spend too long wondering what I was supposed to do?</li>
                    <li><strong>Teamwork</strong>: Could I have done this myself? (Did I do it myself)? Does this room force me to rely on my teammates? And is that more frustrating than it's worth?<</li>
                    <li><strong>Overall Experience</strong>: Did I continue to think about the experience at it was over? How was the staff involvement? Did the room's pacing keep me excited throughout?</li>
